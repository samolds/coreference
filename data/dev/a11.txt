WASHINGTON  -  The U.S. Navy ordered all of its F-14s out of the
skies for at least three days after one of them crashed on Thursday
in the Persian Gulf, the third crash of an F-14 in the last month.


The two-man crew survived the crash, ejecting into the northern
waters of the gulf, and were rescued and returned to the carrier
Nimitz.


The two crewmen, who were not identified, were reported to have
suffered minor injuries.


The three-day shutdown of the Navy's fleet of more than 330
F-14s was ordered by the chief of naval operations, Adm. Jeremy M.
Boorda, who said in an interview at the Pentagon that while there
was no immediate evidence of a connection among the three crashes,
"This is an airplane that we worry about."


"A jinxed airplane?" he said. "No. But known deficiencies in
the earlier models? Yes, and we're working on that, including some
changes to the aircraft."


He said the three-day review might result in new restrictions on
use of the plane, nicknamed the Tomcat, which has the highest
accident rate for jet fighters in the Navy fleet. Ten F-14s have
gone down in the past two years, and 32 since 1991. Each plane
costs more than $30 million.


"We may come out with some more operational restrictions, but
it's way too early to say that," the admiral said. "This is too
serious a business to be guessing about."


Navy officials said that during the shutdown, special engineers
and other safety experts would review the evidence available from
the three recent crashes and inspect the rest of the fleet for
defects in the planes, in their maintenance, or in pilot training.


Earlier models of the fighter, called the F-14A, were plagued
with engine problems when they entered the Navy's fleet of
carrier-based jet fighters in 1973. Specifically, the engines used
on the first model were not powerful enough for a fighter of its
size.


The Navy was forced to impose strict restrictions on how pilots
could operate the aircraft, and had to replace many of the engines.
Two of the three planes that have crashed since late January were
F-14As.


The engines installed in later models, the F-14B and the F-14D,
were more powerful and have proved more reliable. Despite the
troubles of the F-14 fleet, the rate of accidents among all Navy
fighter planes has come down dramatically in recent years, a record
that has made the recent spate of crashes all the more alarming.


In the first of the crashes this year, an F-14A crashed into a
residential neighborhood in Nashville, Tenn., on Jan. 29, seconds
after takeoff. The two-man crew was killed, along with three people
on the ground. The pilot was involved in another F-14 crash in
1995.


Last Sunday, the crew of an F-14D was killed when the fighter
plunged into the Pacific off the coast of Southern California
during exercises.


The F-14 that crashed on Thursday had flown from the Nimitz,
which is sailing in the Persian Gulf to enforce a no-fly zone over
southern Iraq, an operation that dates from the end of the 1991 war
in the gulf. Navy officials said that the plane was on a routine
training mission. They would not speculate on the cause of the
crash.


The plane, which was manufacutred by the Grumman Corp. of Long
Island, has gone out of production, and the Navy has begun to phase
out the plane entirely, replacing it with the F-18.
