NORTHROP GRUMMAN F 14S TO STAND DOWN FOR REVIEW OF ACCIDENTS

Washington, Feb. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The Navy ordered its Northrop
Grumman Corp. F-14s out of the skies for three days while it
investigates three recent F-14 crashes.


The action came after an F-14A fighter crashed today in the
Persian Gulf. The two crew members ejected and were rescued and
returned to the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz with minor injuries,
the Navy said.


Sunday, an F-14D crashed into the Pacific Ocean off southern
California, killing its two crew members. And on Jan. 29, an F-14A
crashed into houses in Nashville, Tennessee, after takeoff, killing
the two crew members and three people on the ground.


The cause of today's crash is undetermined.


"In light of the recent mishaps involving F-14As and Ds, the
Navy has ordered a 72-hour safety standdown for all F-14
aircraft," said Lt. Greg Geisen, a Navy spokesman at the Pentagon.


"Although different models of the F-14 have been involved in
these mishaps, it is prudent to temporarily suspend routine flight
operations for all F-14s in order to assess the available
information and determine if procedural or other modifications to
F-14 operations are warranted," the Navy said.


A one-time exception to the standdown will be allowed for 14
F-14s on board the USS America, which is returning to the United
States from the Persian Gulf and Bosnia, Geisen said. Those planes
will be permitted to fly to Oceana Naval Air Station, Virginia, as
the ship nears port.


The F14 "Tomcat" is the Navy's first-line fighter aircraft. It
has two-engines and is capable of action in all weather, day or
night. The Navy has about 330 F-14s in three models, As, Bs and Ds.


The models differ mainly in engines and avionics. The A model
uses engines from Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies
Corp. The B and D models use General Electric engines.


The Navy said there have been F-14 32 crashes since 1991. That
figure isn't uncommon for Navy jet fighter aircraft, Geisen said.


The aircraft was introduced to the fleet in the mid 1970s, and
has undergone several upgrades since then, Geisen said. The planes
were made by Grumman Corp., now Northrop Grumman, principally in
Calverton, New York, on Long Island. The company delivered the last
F-14 to the Navy in 1992, said Northrop Grumman spokesman John
Vosilla. He referred all questions about today's crash to the Navy.


Aviation safety and engineering experts will review the data
from the three recent crashes and are to present their findings to
the Chief of Naval Operations Mike Boorda in three days, Geisen
said.


Northrop Grumman shares were up 3/8 to 66 1/4 at midday.
