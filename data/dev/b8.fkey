 <COREF ID="X7">Striking auto workers</COREF> and <COREF ID="X8">Chrysler Corp.'s Canadian unit</COREF> appeared to be making progress in <COREF ID="X9">negotiations</COREF> <COREF ID="X10">yesterday</COREF>, as <COREF ID="4" REF="X8">the company</COREF> said <COREF ID="5" REF="4">it</COREF> planned to make <COREF ID="6" REF="X2">a new contract offer</COREF> by this morning. 


 Meanwhile, in Dearborn, Mich., <COREF ID="X33">Ford Motor Co.</COREF> and <COREF ID="X34">the United Auto Workers union</COREF> continued <COREF ID="9" REF="X5">negotiations</COREF> into the evening <COREF ID="10" REF="X10">yesterday</COREF>, but neither side would officially discuss progress. 


 Early in <COREF ID="11" REF="10">the day</COREF>, <COREF ID="X11">bargaining committee members</COREF> had reported to <COREF ID="12" REF="X11">their</COREF> <COREF ID="13" REF="X34">union</COREF> locals that <COREF ID="X12">a settlement</COREF> was imminent. 
 Still, <COREF ID="14" REF="9">negotiations</COREF> dragged on. 
 Late last night <COREF ID="15" REF="13">union</COREF> officials were still hoping to announce <COREF ID="16" REF="X12">a settlement</COREF> by early this morning. 


 <COREF ID="X13">UAW President Owen Bieber</COREF> was absent from the talks all day. 
 <COREF ID="18" REF="X13">The 57-year-old union leader</COREF> checked into Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit <COREF ID="X15">Tuesday</COREF> night for testing because of abdominal pain, <COREF ID="X16">one source</COREF> said. 
 The tests ruled out any heart problems, and <COREF ID="20" REF="18">Mr. Bieber</COREF> was apparently in "good condition," <COREF ID="21" REF="X16">the source</COREF> said. 
 <COREF ID="22" REF="21">He</COREF> added that <COREF ID="23" REF="20">Mr. Bieber</COREF>'s hospitalization doesn't affect the pace of <COREF ID="24" REF="14">negotiations</COREF>. 
 A <COREF ID="25" REF="15">UAW</COREF> spokesman would neither confirm nor deny the report. 


 In Toronto, <COREF ID="X17">Robert White, </COREF><COREF ID="26" REF="X17">president of the Canadian Auto Workers union</COREF>, said <COREF ID="28" REF="26">he</COREF> expects <COREF ID="29" REF="6">the new offer</COREF> from <COREF ID="30" REF="5">Chrysler Canada Ltd.</COREF> to contain <COREF ID="X18">sweetened cost-of-living adjustments for pensioners</COREF>. 


 <COREF ID="X35">The Canadian union</COREF> has made <COREF ID="32" REF="X18">inflation-indexed pension payments</COREF> <COREF ID="34" REF="X35">its</COREF> top priority in <COREF ID="35" REF="X9">the talks</COREF>. 
 <COREF ID="36" REF="28">Mr. White</COREF> said negotiators "unlocked the logjam on <COREF ID="X19">the main issue</COREF>" after all-night meetings <COREF ID="37" REF="X15">Tuesday</COREF> and <COREF ID="38" REF="11">yesterday</COREF>. 


 <COREF ID="39" REF="34">The union</COREF> struck <COREF ID="40" REF="30">Chrysler Canada</COREF> <COREF ID="41" REF="37">Tuesday</COREF> after rejecting <COREF ID="42" REF="40">a company</COREF> offer on <COREF ID="X20">pension adjustments</COREF>. 
 <COREF ID="44" REF="39">The union</COREF> said the size of <COREF ID="45" REF="X20">the adjustments</COREF> was inadequate. 


 But <COREF ID="X21">Chrysler Canada's chief negotiator, </COREF><COREF ID="47" REF="X21">William Fisher</COREF>, said <COREF ID="48" REF="38">yesterday</COREF> that <COREF ID="X22">the two sides</COREF> had reached "some understandings" on economic issues, including pensions. 
 "<COREF ID="50" REF="X22">We</COREF> have a good chance of wrapping something up by <COREF ID="51" REF="X4">the end of the week</COREF>," <COREF ID="52" REF="47">he</COREF> said. 


 <COREF ID="53" REF="36">Mr. White</COREF> allowed negotiations on <COREF ID="X23">local issues</COREF> to resume <COREF ID="54" REF="48">yesterday</COREF>. 
 <COREF ID="55" REF="X23">About 200 local issues</COREF> that remain unsettled had been suspended while the <COREF ID="56" REF="44">CAW</COREF> and <COREF ID="57" REF="42">Chrysler</COREF> grappled with <COREF ID="58" REF="X19">the pension issue</COREF>. 


 If a settlement comes <COREF ID="60" REF="X6">today</COREF> or tomorrow, <COREF ID="61" REF="X1">Chrysler</COREF>'s 10,000 Canadian workers could vote on <COREF ID="62" REF="29">a contract</COREF> <COREF ID="63" REF="51">this weekend</COREF>, when <COREF ID="64" REF="56">the union</COREF> has scheduled membership meetings for <COREF ID="65" REF="X7">the striking workers</COREF>. 
 <COREF ID="66" REF="61">Chrysler</COREF> said <COREF ID="67" REF="66">its</COREF> four Canadian plants could resume production Monday if <COREF ID="68" REF="62">a new pact</COREF> is accepted. 


 A <COREF ID="69" REF="67">company</COREF> spokesman said about 2,285 workers remain on layoff at two <COREF ID="X24">U.S.</COREF> plants as a result of <COREF ID="70" REF="X3">the Canadian strike</COREF>. 
 As previously reported, <COREF ID="71" REF="69">Chrysler</COREF> stopped output of Dodge Dynasty and Chrysler New Yorker cars yesterday at <COREF ID="X25">its Belvidere, Ill., plant</COREF> because of a shortage of Canadian-made parts. 
 Some 1,700 of <COREF ID="73" REF="X25">the plant</COREF>'s 2,900 hourly employees were laid off as a result. 


 Also, <COREF ID="X26">about 585 workers</COREF> were laid off at <COREF ID="X27">a stamping plant near Detroit</COREF> because the parts <COREF ID="75" REF="X26">they</COREF> make aren't needed in Canada during <COREF ID="76" REF="70">the strike</COREF>. 
 <COREF ID="77" REF="X27">That plant</COREF> normally employs 2,800 hourly workers. 


 The <COREF ID="78" REF="64">CAW</COREF>'s contracts with <COREF ID="79" REF="71">Chrysler</COREF> and the Canadian units of <COREF ID="X28">General Motors Corp.</COREF> and <COREF ID="80" REF="X33">Ford Motor Co.</COREF> expired <COREF ID="X29">Monday</COREF>. 
 Talks with <COREF ID="81" REF="X28">GM</COREF> and <COREF ID="82" REF="80">Ford</COREF> are on hold pending the outcome of <COREF ID="83" REF="35">the Chrysler talks</COREF>. 


 In <COREF ID="85" REF="24">the Ford-UAW talks</COREF>, <COREF ID="X30">the two parties</COREF> turned to economics <COREF ID="88" REF="54">yesterday</COREF> in addition to <COREF ID="X31">the job-security issue</COREF>. 
 Sources said <COREF ID="90" REF="82">Ford</COREF> expressed willingness to offer some sort of base-wage raise, or annual improvement factor, but it wasn't clear how much or for how many years. 
 In <COREF ID="X32">the previous contract</COREF>, <COREF ID="91" REF="90">the company</COREF> made lump-sum payments instead of base-wage raises in two of the three years. 
 <COREF ID="92" REF="91">It</COREF> offered no base-wage raises in <COREF ID="93" REF="92">its</COREF> initial proposal this year. 


 On <COREF ID="94" REF="X31">the job-security issue</COREF>, it is understood that <COREF ID="96" REF="93">Ford</COREF> agreed not to lay off any workers during the life of the contract except during a major sales plunge. 
 <COREF ID="97" REF="96">The company</COREF> also promised to replace half of all workers leaving <COREF ID="98" REF="97">the company</COREF>. 
 At last report, <COREF ID="99" REF="X30">the two sides</COREF> were still haggling over details of the job-security plan, while also discussing the wage and benefit package. 


 <COREF ID="101" REF="X32">The contract</COREF> expired at midnight <COREF ID="102" REF="X29">Monday</COREF>, but <COREF ID="103" REF="25">the union</COREF>, citing progress, agreed to an indefinite extension. 


 The <COREF ID="104" REF="103">UAW</COREF>'s contract with <COREF ID="105" REF="81">GM</COREF> also expired <COREF ID="106" REF="102">Monday</COREF>, but negotiations with <COREF ID="107" REF="105">the No. 1 auto maker</COREF> were postponed pending a settlement with <COREF ID="108" REF="98">Ford</COREF>. 
 <COREF ID="109" REF="79">Chrysler</COREF>'s <COREF ID="110" REF="X24">U.S.</COREF> contract doesn't expire until next year. 


 <COREF ID="111" REF="88">Yesterday</COREF> in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, <COREF ID="112" REF="109">Chrysler</COREF> closed at $42.25, down $1. 
 <COREF ID="113" REF="108">Ford</COREF> closed at $104, down 62.5 cents.
