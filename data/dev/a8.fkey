The <COREF ID="4" REF="X4">Federal Aviation Administration</COREF> underestimated <COREF ID="5" REF="X5">the number</COREF> of
aircraft flying over the <COREF ID="7" REF="1">Pantex Weapons Plant</COREF> outside <COREF ID="X8">Amarillo</COREF>,
<COREF ID="X9">Texas</COREF>, where much of the nation's surplus <COREF ID="8" REF="X6">plutonium</COREF> is stored,
according to computerized studies under way by the <COREF ID="X10">Energy
Department</COREF>.


The <COREF ID="9" REF="4">FAA</COREF> counted <COREF ID="X11">each flight</COREF> at <COREF ID="X12">Amarillo International Airport</COREF>
once. But <COREF ID="X13">military training planes</COREF> make up to 30 <COREF ID="10" REF="2">passes</COREF> per <COREF ID="11" REF="X11">flight</COREF>
over <COREF ID="12" REF="7">the plant</COREF>, according to the <COREF ID="X14">Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety
Board</COREF>.


The secretary of <COREF ID="13" REF="X10">Energy</COREF> and local farmers have expressed concern
that <COREF ID="X15">a plane crash into a plutonium storage bunker at Pantex</COREF> could
spread radioactive smoke for miles. <COREF ID="17" REF="8">Plutonium</COREF>, <COREF ID="18" REF="17">a highly radioactive
element</COREF>, causes cancer if inhaled.


<COREF ID="X16">The risk of that scenario</COREF>, previously estimated at <COREF ID="20" REF="X16">one chance in
10 million</COREF>, is expected to increase when current <COREF ID="21" REF="11">flight</COREF> data are
analyzed later <COREF ID="22" REF="X7">this year</COREF>, according to <COREF ID="23" REF="X14">a safety board</COREF> memo dated
May 2.


``This doesn't surprise <COREF ID="X17">me</COREF> at all,'' said <COREF ID="24" REF="X17">Trish Neusch</COREF>, who
farms <COREF ID="X18">land near the plant</COREF> 17 miles northeast of <COREF ID="26" REF="X8">Amarillo</COREF> and 7
miles from <COREF ID="27" REF="X12">the airport</COREF>. ``We are out <COREF ID="28" REF="X18">there</COREF> and see <COREF ID="29" REF="X13">these planes</COREF> all
the time.''


<COREF ID="X19">Mike McNulty</COREF>, <COREF ID="30" REF="X19">the FAA air traffic manager</COREF> at Amarillo
International, said <COREF ID="X20">the previous aircraft count</COREF>, conducted in late
1994, was <COREF ID="34" REF="X20">a ``manual count on a pad,''</COREF> done informally by <COREF ID="X21">air
traffic controllers</COREF>.


<COREF ID="35" REF="34">That 60-day accounting</COREF> estimated that <COREF ID="36" REF="5">25 planes a day</COREF> entered
<COREF ID="X22">flight patterns</COREF> over the zone where plutonium is stored in concrete
bunkers covered with earth and grass.


<COREF ID="39" REF="12">Pantex</COREF> is operated by <COREF ID="40" REF="13">the Energy Department</COREF> through a private
contractor and employs 3,600 workers, whose main mission is to
dismantle nuclear warheads. The hollow <COREF ID="41" REF="18">plutonium</COREF> ball at the core
of each weapon is stored at <COREF ID="42" REF="39">the former weapons assembly plant</COREF>.


<COREF ID="43" REF="27">The Amarillo airport</COREF> averages <COREF ID="X23">250 takeoffs and landings per day</COREF>,
<COREF ID="45" REF="30">McNulty</COREF> said. <COREF ID="X24">About half the aircraft</COREF> are <COREF ID="47" REF="X24">military planes</COREF> assigned
to Air Force bases in <COREF ID="48" REF="X9">Texas</COREF>, <COREF ID="X25">Oklahoma</COREF>, Kansas and New Mexico, <COREF ID="49" REF="45">he</COREF>
said.


<COREF ID="50" REF="36">About 25 percent of the airport traffic</COREF> enters <COREF ID="53" REF="X22">a flight pattern</COREF>
over the <COREF ID="X29">plutonium storage bunkers</COREF>, <COREF ID="56" REF="49">McNulty</COREF> said. For the past 14
months, <COREF ID="57" REF="X21">air traffic controllers</COREF> have tried to steer planes away
from <COREF ID="79" REF="X29">the bunkers</COREF>, <COREF ID="59" REF="56">he</COREF> said.


Two of the <COREF ID="60" REF="43">airport</COREF>'s dozen flight paths are directly above <COREF ID="61" REF="79">the
nuclear storage area</COREF>, <COREF ID="62" REF="59">McNulty</COREF> said. One approach will be eliminated
by late summer or early fall when a new instrument landing system
is installed, <COREF ID="63" REF="62">he</COREF> said.


The second flight path cannot be altered until <COREF ID="X26">sophisticated
equipment</COREF>, called <COREF ID="64" REF="X26">VORTAC</COREF>, is phased out at Dallas/Fort Worth
Airport and installed in <COREF ID="65" REF="26">Amarillo</COREF>, <COREF ID="66" REF="63">he</COREF> said. There is no target date
for the transition.


<COREF ID="67" REF="66">McNulty</COREF> downplayed the dangers posed by <COREF ID="X27">some military traffic</COREF> by
noting that <COREF ID="68" REF="X27">these planes</COREF> often fly at high altitudes and stay 2 to
8 miles from <COREF ID="69" REF="61">the plutonium area</COREF>.


``<COREF ID="X28">They</COREF> are counting something at 35,000 as well as 500 feet,
when in actuality a plane would have to start falling in <COREF ID="73" REF="X25">Oklahoma</COREF>
to hit <COREF ID="74" REF="42">the plant</COREF>,'' <COREF ID="75" REF="67">McNulty</COREF> said. ``<COREF ID="76" REF="X28">They</COREF> are just collecting a lot
of raw data.''
