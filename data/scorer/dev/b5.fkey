 <COREF ID="X4">I</COREF> was pleased to see <COREF ID="X5">your May 5 article</COREF>, "<COREF ID="X14">Farm-Debt Mediation</COREF> Catches On in Iowa."
 <COREF ID="5" REF="X14">Farm-debt mediation</COREF> is, indeed, a Farm Belt success story in the midst of <COREF ID="X6">the most devastating crash in the farm economy since the Great Depression</COREF>. 


 <COREF ID="10" REF="X4">I</COREF> am compelled, however, to comment on <COREF ID="11" REF="X1">your</COREF> evaluation of <COREF ID="X7">Minnesota's mediation program</COREF>. 
 While <COREF ID="14" REF="X7">Minnesota's program</COREF> has met some resistance from <COREF ID="X8">creditors</COREF>, <COREF ID="16" REF="14">it</COREF> nonetheless has been a solid success. 
 As of April 24, there were 3,864 mediations that either have been completed or were in progress. 
 Of the 2,939 completed mediations, 1,393 -- or 46% -- resulted in an agreement. 
 It is clear from these figures that despite the naysayers, <COREF ID="17" REF="16">Minnesota mediation</COREF> works. 
 <COREF ID="19" REF="17">It</COREF> helps keep <COREF ID="X9">farmers</COREF> on the land and <COREF ID="20" REF="X8">creditors</COREF> in business. 
 Most important, as <COREF ID="X10">the University of Minnesota</COREF> found when <COREF ID="21" REF="X10">it</COREF> evaluated <COREF ID="22" REF="16">the program</COREF> last winter, <COREF ID="23" REF="X3">mediation</COREF> has reduced significantly the threat of violence in rural areas. 


 Moreover, recent data indicate that <COREF ID="24" REF="23">mediation</COREF> is a viable alternative to bankruptcy. 
 An analysis completed by the Center for Rural Affairs indicates that states with <COREF ID="25" REF="24">mediation</COREF> have had proportionately fewer <COREF ID="X11">Chapter 12</COREF> bankruptcy filings. 
 Of the six Midwestern states surveyed, <COREF ID="26" REF="X2">Minnesota</COREF> had the fewest <COREF ID="27" REF="X11">Chapter 12</COREF> filings per 1,000 farmers. 


 As <COREF ID="28" REF="X5">your article</COREF> notes, the Minnesota Legislature is considering <COREF ID="X12">various amendments to the Mediation Act</COREF>. 
 However, <COREF ID="30" REF="X12">the proposed amendments</COREF> are not the result of "<COREF ID="31" REF="25">mediation</COREF>-bashing," as <COREF ID="32" REF="28">the article</COREF> suggests. 
 Rather, <COREF ID="33" REF="30">they</COREF> are the result of a growing consensus that <COREF ID="34" REF="31">mediation</COREF> works and should be improved in order to ensure <COREF ID="35" REF="34">it</COREF> works even better. 


 <COREF ID="X13">The program's record</COREF> speaks for <COREF ID="37" REF="X13">itself</COREF>. 
 <COREF ID="38" REF="37">It</COREF> demonstrates that <COREF ID="39" REF="X9">farmers</COREF> and lenders can work together to solve the challenge created by <COREF ID="40" REF="X6">the continuing crisis</COREF> in our nation's rural economy.
