NAVY GROUNDS F 14'S AFTER THIRD RECENT CRASH

WASHINGTON  -  The Navy suspended operations for its entire fleet
of F-14 airplanes Thursday after the third "Tomcat" crash in a
month  -  the second in a week.


The 72-hour "safety stand-down" came shortly after an F-14
fighter from the USS Nimitz crashed during flight operations in the
northern Persian Gulf at about 6:30 a.m. EST.


The Navy announced that the two Naval aviators on board were
rescued by a SH-60 helicopter after they ejected from the aircraft.
The Navy said that both men were in good condition. One aviator
suffered minor abrasions. The Navy is investigating the cause.


Another Tomcat crashed off the coast of California during
exercises on the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson on Sunday. Both crew
members were killed. Late last month, an F-14 crashed near
Nashville, killing both crew members and three civilians on the
ground.


Although the crash Thursday was the third Tomcat crash this
year, Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the Navy had
uncovered no evidence of a flaw in the aircraft.


A safety stand-down is a procedure the military uses to conduct
an intensive review. During this three-day period, the three
classes of F-14s will stay out of the air so Navy personnel can
review maintenance procedures and equipment, plus check each
aircraft for weaknesses or deficiencies.


The F-14s on the deck of the USS America will be allowed to fly
off because the aircraft carrier is returning from a deployment.
Carrier decks are routinely cleared of aircraft the day before the
carrier docks.


"We do not know what has caused these three crashes this
year," Bacon said. "The goal of the stand-down is to take a time
out to look at everything involved with the F-14s.


Adm. Jeremy Boorda, the chief of Naval Operations, informed
Deputy Defense Secretary John White of the latest crash Thursday
morning and told him he was ordering the standdown for the entire
fleet of more than 300 aircraft, Bacon said.


"What the Navy is trying to do is find out what caused these
accidents," Bacon said.


&UR;   In the past five years, 32 F-14s have crashed. One of the
Navy's first female pilots, Lt. Kara Hultgren, died while trying to
land an F-14 on an aircraft carrier in 1994. The Navy concluded
that engine failure caused that crash.


The Tomcat, a $38 million, twin-engine aircraft built by the
Grumman Aerospace Corp., is the standard fighter plane used by the
Navy for close-in air combat. The aircraft has been in operation
since 1973. The oldest version of the aircraft, the F-14A, is
scheduled to be phased out by the year 2004.


The crash rate for the F-14 dropped dramatically after the
initial years of deployment and has generally gone down since then
except for occasional spurts of accidents, according to Naval
records.


Bacon said the Navy had no single explanation for the increases
in F-14 accidents.


"The Navy informs me that they have been unable to find a
common thread to these accidents," Bacon said. "This is a
mystery."
