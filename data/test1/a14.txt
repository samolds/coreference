NEW PRESSURES ON AIRLINE CRASH LIABILITY ACCORD

(lh)

WASHINGTON  -  The Warsaw Convention governing the liability of an
airline when passengers die in a plane crash is crumbling as
airlines try to raise the accord's $75,000 limit on damages.


But prospects for a new agreement are uncertain, because the
U.S. Department of Transportation is demanding that the accord
provide that damage suits involving Americans be heard in the
United States. Some foreign airlines reject that demand.


This is the third effort to raise the $75,000 limit, which was
set in 1966 and which all parties agree is now far too low. Efforts
in 1977 and 1988 would have raised the limit several-fold and were
eagerly supported by U.S. officials, but the United States did not
approve them. Trial lawyers said the higher limits were still too
low, and aircraft manufacturers feared high limits would encourage
suits against them.


"The amount of time it's taking to do something rational is
simply astonishing," said Jeffrey N. Shane, an aviation lawyer who
was assistant secretary of transportation for policy and
international affairs from 1989 to 1993.


The Warsaw Convention, initiated in 1929 among 29 countries and
joined by the United States in 1934, also governs who may sue and
where, and details cargo rules. All nations with commercial
airlines have signed on, but the airlines agree that the document
needs to be updated.


Because of the low liability limit, many airlines are
voluntarily paying more, either to spare themselves a lengthy trial
at which families will try to show negligence  -  which allows higher
damages  -  or for general good will, or because they do not think
the limits will hold up in court.


American Airlines, for example, has told families of the people
who died when one of its planes crashed in Colombia in December
that it would negotiate as if the limit did not exist; it is doing
the same for the 16 passengers on international trips who were on
the American Eagle commuter flight that crashed in Roselawn, Ind.,
in October 1994.


"The message American is sending is, `We'll do what's fair,
because we know a jury will do what's fairer,"' said Barry Lambert
Harris, who was an acting administrator of the Federal Aviation
Administration in the Bush administration.


But the airlines would like a realistic limit and uniform
system. Representatives of airlines from around the world met this
week in Montreal to try to work out the details of a system with no
limits. U.S. airlines have received an antitrust exemption to
negotiate an agreement, which would be subject to government
approval.


The airlines and U.S. officials envision fairly simple
negotiations with families over "economic damages," the amount
that the victim was likely to have earned over the remaining years
of his or her life, given normal life expectancy. The sticking
point now is which court would resolve disputes if negotiations
failed.


Under the current agreement, survivors can bring suit in the
country the plane was flying to, the home country of the airline, a
country where the airline has its major operation or the country
where the contract for transportation was written.


The United States wants a "fifth jurisdiction" for Americans:
the United States. Since domestic carriers are based here, they can
already be sued here; adding the "fifth jurisdiction" would
generally affect overseas carriers.
