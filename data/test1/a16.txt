TWO DIE IN HELO CRASH OFF CHINA

c.1996 South China Morning Post
By JONATHAN HILL and ADAM LEE in Macau Two Chinese crew members
were killed Tuesday when their helicopter crashed near Macau.



The China Southern Helicopter Company aircraft was on its way to
Zhuhai, apparently returning from an oil rig, when it crashed, said
a spokesman for Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Department.


Other reports said the helicopter, which went down 10 to 15
nautical miles southeast of the Portuguese enclave, was gathering
weather information.


The incident fell within Hong Kong airspace, triggering a search
by Civil Aviation Department rescuers.


Two Government Flying Service helicopters joined Macau Marine
Police in the search for the Sikorsky 76.


Mainland authorities later told the department's Aeronautical
Rescue Co-ordination Centre the wreckage had been recovered from
the Chinese island of Daiwaishan.


"Someone on the island heard a noise and called Zhuhai airport
authorities," said a Macau aviation source. "China sent a
helicopter and confirmed the crash on the island."


Macau authorities, who lost radar contact at 10 am, said the
pilots had been found at the site "and appeared dead".


Zhuhai officials confirmed the crew had been killed.


Sources suggested that poor weather was the likely cause of the
crash.


The Royal Observatory reported strong winds in the area at the
time. Rescuers also reported poor visibility.


China, as the country of registration, would investigate the
incident, the Civil Aviation Department said.
