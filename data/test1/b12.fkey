 <COREF ID="1" REF="X1">Communications Satellite Corp., Washington</COREF>, said <COREF ID="3" REF="1">it</COREF> submitted to the Federal Communications Commission a proposal to reduce by 50% rates for certain international telecommunication services. 


 In exchange for <COREF ID="X2">the reductions</COREF>, customers such as <COREF ID="X3">American Telephone @amp; Telegraph Co.</COREF> would have to commit themselves to using one of <COREF ID="X4">two new types of digital satellite services</COREF> for a 10-year period, <COREF ID="4" REF="3">Comsat</COREF> said. 


 The proposal is part of a multi-year agreement between <COREF ID="5" REF="4">Comsat</COREF> and <COREF ID="6" REF="X3">AT@amp;T</COREF> that guarantees <COREF ID="7" REF="5">Comsat</COREF> a portion of <COREF ID="8" REF="6">the telephone company</COREF>'s international business in the face of growing competition from fiber-optic cables. 


 <COREF ID="9" REF="7">Comsat</COREF> said <COREF ID="10" REF="8">AT@amp;T</COREF> and other customers would be able to convert gradually to <COREF ID="11" REF="X4">the new digital service</COREF> beginning next year, and that by 1994, as much as 83% of a customer's international circuits could qualify for <COREF ID="12" REF="X2">the price reductions</COREF>. 


 <COREF ID="13" REF="11">Digital service</COREF> allows telecommunications customers to subdivide satellite circuits to handle more than one message at a time, <COREF ID="14" REF="9">Comsat</COREF> said.
