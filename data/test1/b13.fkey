 <COREF ID="X4">The National Mediation Board</COREF> is expected to release <COREF ID="1" REF="X1">Pan Am Corp.</COREF> and <COREF ID="2" REF="X2">its Teamsters union</COREF> from <COREF ID="77" REF="X3">their long-stalled contract negotiations</COREF>, throwing into question <COREF ID="X6">a wage-concession agreement</COREF>. 


 The release means <COREF ID="X21">both sides</COREF> will be asked to submit to <COREF ID="X7">arbitration</COREF>; if one of the parties refuses, as is expected, a 30-day cooling off period will go into effect, after which <COREF ID="6" REF="2">the Teamsters</COREF> are free to strike. 


 <COREF ID="X8">William Genoese</COREF>, <COREF ID="7" REF="X8">head of the airline division of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters</COREF>, said <COREF ID="9" REF="7">he</COREF> was "shocked and surprised" when <COREF ID="10" REF="9">he</COREF> heard late Friday from negotiator Walter Wallace of <COREF ID="11" REF="X4">the board</COREF>'s plans to release <COREF ID="12" REF="X21">the parties</COREF> from <COREF ID="13" REF="X3">negotiations</COREF>. 


 At noon EST <COREF ID="X9">today</COREF>, <COREF ID="14" REF="11">the mediation board</COREF> is expected to ask <COREF ID="15" REF="12">both parties</COREF> to submit to <COREF ID="16" REF="X7">arbitration</COREF>. 


 As previously reported, <COREF ID="17" REF="1">Pan Am</COREF> had asked <COREF ID="18" REF="14">the National Mediation Board</COREF> to declare an impasse in <COREF ID="19" REF="13">the talks</COREF> in late December. 
 But <COREF ID="20" REF="17">Pan Am</COREF>, sensing progress in <COREF ID="21" REF="20">its</COREF> recent negotiations with the unions, asked <COREF ID="22" REF="18">the board</COREF> to delay acting on <COREF ID="23" REF="21">the company</COREF>'s request, a source close to <COREF ID="24" REF="22">the board</COREF> said. 


 Also as previously reported, <COREF ID="25" REF="23">Pan Am</COREF> said last week <COREF ID="26" REF="25">it</COREF> would make "<COREF ID="X10">changes in senior management</COREF>" in exchange for <COREF ID="X11">labor-cost concessions</COREF> of $180 million a year for three years from the unions of its Pan American World Airways unit. 
 <COREF ID="29" REF="X6">The agreement</COREF> was reached by <COREF ID="X12">a coalition of four of Pan Am's five unions</COREF>; <COREF ID="31" REF="2">the Teamsters union</COREF> was part of <COREF ID="32" REF="X12">that coalition</COREF> -- but has made it clear recently <COREF ID="33" REF="31">it</COREF> did not necessarily go along with <COREF ID="34" REF="29">the agreement</COREF>. 


 For the past year, <COREF ID="35" REF="32">the coalition</COREF> has been trying to force a restructuring of <COREF ID="36" REF="26">Pan Am</COREF> and <COREF ID="37" REF="X10">a change in top management</COREF>. 
 Negotiations have been held with <COREF ID="X13">William T. Coleman</COREF>, <COREF ID="39" REF="X13">a Pan Am director and Washington attorney</COREF>. 


 <COREF ID="42" REF="36">Pan Am</COREF>'s directors are scheduled to meet <COREF ID="X14">tomorrow</COREF>, <COREF ID="43" REF="X14">the deadline</COREF> set for the union's wage-concession agreement. 
 It wasn't immediately clear if <COREF ID="46" REF="33">the Teamsters</COREF>'s release might jeopardize <COREF ID="47" REF="34">that agreement</COREF>. 


 Last Saturday, <COREF ID="48" REF="10">Mr. Genoese</COREF> said <COREF ID="49" REF="48">he</COREF> sent a telegram to <COREF ID="X22">Mr. Coleman</COREF> to announce that <COREF ID="51" REF="46">the Teamsters</COREF> plan to end <COREF ID="52" REF="19">their talks with the company</COREF>. 
 <COREF ID="55" REF="49">Mr. Genoese</COREF> said <COREF ID="56" REF="55">he</COREF> had <COREF ID="X15">a "cordial" initial meeting with Mr. Coleman last Thursday</COREF>, but made no commitment to provide concessions. 


 "<COREF ID="58" REF="X15">That meeting</COREF> made it clear to <COREF ID="59" REF="X22">Mr. Coleman</COREF> that <COREF ID="60" REF="51">the Teamsters</COREF> and <COREF ID="61" REF="42">Pan Am</COREF> are still deadlocked," one source close to <COREF ID="62" REF="52">the negotiations</COREF> said. 


 "As far as <COREF ID="63" REF="60">we</COREF>'re concerned, <COREF ID="64" REF="61">the company</COREF> triggered this," <COREF ID="65" REF="56">Mr. Genoese</COREF> said. 
 "<COREF ID="66" REF="63">We</COREF>'re not negotiating any more with <COREF ID="67" REF="64">Pan Am</COREF>. 
 <COREF ID="68" REF="66">We</COREF>'re in strike procedure now." 
 <COREF ID="69" REF="68">The union</COREF> has already indicated <COREF ID="70" REF="69">it</COREF> would not be willing to submit to <COREF ID="71" REF="16">arbitration</COREF>. 


 A <COREF ID="72" REF="67">Pan Am</COREF> spokesman declined to comment. 


 <COREF ID="73" REF="70">The Teamsters</COREF>, which represent about 4,500 ticket agents, reservation agents and clerical workers, have been working under a contract that was negotiated in 1978 and scheduled to be renegotiated in 1981. 
 <COREF ID="74" REF="24">The federal mediation board</COREF> has rejected several earlier requests by <COREF ID="75" REF="73">the union</COREF> to declare <COREF ID="76" REF="62">the negotiations</COREF> deadlocked. 


 Meanwhile, <COREF ID="X17">Pan Am's pilots union</COREF> said <COREF ID="78" REF="X17">it</COREF> is preparing to sign <COREF ID="X18">an agreement to deliver concessions to the company</COREF> <COREF ID="81" REF="X9">today</COREF>. 
 <COREF ID="X19">A pilot's union spokesman</COREF> said <COREF ID="X20">the leaders</COREF> plan to take <COREF ID="83" REF="X18">the agreement</COREF> to <COREF ID="84" REF="X20">their</COREF> membership for ratification. 
 <COREF ID="85" REF="X19">He</COREF> said <COREF ID="86" REF="85">he</COREF> didn't know how <COREF ID="87" REF="75">the Teamsters</COREF> action would affect <COREF ID="88" REF="83">the union's agreement with the company</COREF>.
