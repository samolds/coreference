SOMBER FAREWELL IN CROATIA FOR U.S. VICTIMS

DUBROVNIK, Croatia  -  The coffins carrying the remains of
Commerce Secretary Ron Brown and 32 other Americans killed in a
plane crash Wednesday were loaded onto two C-17 transport planes
that took off for Dover Air Force Base in Delaware after a somber
farewell ceremony in Dubrovnik on Saturday morning.


Croatian and American officials, flanked by 19 American and 19
Croatian honor guards, stood as the last four coffins, two covered
with the American flag and two with the Croatian flag, were laid on
the tarmac. Two of those who died in the crash were Croatian
citizens.


President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, who spoke at the ceremony,
said his nation was "shaken by pain and sorrow."


"Today when we take our leave from Ron Brown and all other
senior U.S. officials, on behalf of the whole of Croatia and
myself, I express my deepest sympathy to the families of those who
have perished," Tudjman said. "You will remain forever in our
memory."


He posthumously awarded Brown a high Croatian decoration.


In a brief euology, the American ambassador to Croatia, Peter W.
Galbraith, reminded those present that Saturday was Easter eve.


"As Jesus said in the Sermon on the Mount," the ambassador
said, "blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the
children of God. Blessed indeed are our friends and colleagues who
perished on a mission of peace."


The Air Force T-43 plane slammed into a rocky hill named after
St. John the Baptist on Wednesday in heavy rain and fog. The 35
passengers on board were killed, most instantly.


The two Croatians and Brown are the only victims whose bodies
have been identified. The remaining bodies, many badly burned or
mutilated, will be identified by forensic experts in the United
States.


Galbraith said the most fitting memorial would be to make peace
"a reality on the ground" and to offer "a vastly better future
to people who in the last five years have suffered so much."


He called on Americans, Croats and Bosnians to build the
"decent, honorable and wonderfully ordinary lives that we
Americans too often take for granted."


The Roman Catholic archbishop of Dubrovnik, Zelimir Puljic, said
a prayer and blessed the remains. A bugler played taps before the
planes taxied to the runway and lifted off in a clear sky for the
11-hour journey.


American investigators continued to search the crash site
Saturday and had cordoned off a debris-covered area with orange
tape and also marked several pieces of wreckage with tape. The
investigating team that will try to determine the causes of the
accident arrived in Dubrovnik on Saturday.


The white tail section of the plane, with the Stars and Stripes
visible, and a few rows of attached passenger seats are the only
large pieces left. A long black burn mark outlined where the body
of the aircraft probably had been. Down the steep, rocky hillside
lay part of the engine and a chunk of the fuselage.
