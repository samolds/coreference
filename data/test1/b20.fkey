 <COREF ID="X1">OPEC</COREF> Appears to Back Off <COREF ID="X2">a Price War</COREF> As <COREF ID="X3">Output</COREF> Sags, <COREF ID="X4">Quota Violator</COREF> Reforms

 <COREF ID="2" REF="X1">The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries</COREF> appears to be pulling back from the brink of <COREF ID="3" REF="X2">a possible price war</COREF>. 


 After recent major <COREF ID="X32">price</COREF> declines because of <COREF ID="X5">a sharp rise in OPEC production</COREF>, <COREF ID="7" REF="X3">total cartel output</COREF> has now dropped as much as one million barrels <COREF ID="X6">a day</COREF> -- from the year's peak of <COREF ID="X7">20 million barrels a day early this month</COREF>. 
 And there are new indications that even <COREF ID="10" REF="X4">the United Arab Emirates, </COREF><COREF ID="11" REF="10">OPEC's most notable quota violator,</COREF> might soon cut <COREF ID="X8">its own output</COREF> below <COREF ID="X9">a targeted 1.5 million barrels a day</COREF> because of pressure from others in <COREF ID="15" REF="2">the cartel</COREF>, including <COREF ID="X10">Saudi Arabia</COREF>. 


 <COREF ID="16" REF="11">The Emirates</COREF> aren't making any promises publicly. 
 But <COREF ID="X11">its government</COREF> did offer <COREF ID="X12">conciliatory gestures to OPEC</COREF> <COREF ID="X13">yesterday</COREF>. 


 <COREF ID="19" REF="X12">The gestures</COREF> followed the arrival in <COREF ID="X14">Abu Dhabi</COREF> of <COREF ID="X15">OPEC's new secretary-general, </COREF><COREF ID="21" REF="X15">Subroto</COREF>. 
 <COREF ID="22" REF="21">Mr. Subroto</COREF> delivered a letter to <COREF ID="X16">Sheik Zayed Al Nahyyan, </COREF><COREF ID="23" REF="X16">the Emirates' ruler,</COREF> from <COREF ID="X17">Rilwanu Lukman, </COREF><COREF ID="25" REF="X17">Nigeria's oil minister and OPEC's president,</COREF> voicing concern over <COREF ID="29" REF="16">the Emirates</COREF>' recent renunciation of <COREF ID="X18">its assigned quota of 948,000 barrels a day</COREF>. 


 The chief conciliatory note at <COREF ID="X19">the round of talks with Mr. Subroto</COREF> came from <COREF ID="33" REF="23">Sheik Zayed, who "reaffirmed" the Emirates' support for OPEC's "unity and cohesion."</COREF> 
 According to <COREF ID="X20">the Emirates' official news agency</COREF>, <COREF ID="37" REF="33">the ruler</COREF> also noted that <COREF ID="38" REF="29">his country</COREF> "has always been at the forefront for boosting <COREF ID="40" REF="15">OPEC</COREF> decisions and supporting the stability of the market." 


 The <COREF ID="41" REF="X20">news agency</COREF> report didn't mention <COREF ID="42" REF="X8">the Emirates' production level</COREF>. 
 But senior <COREF ID="X33">oil</COREF> officials in <COREF ID="45" REF="38">the Emirates</COREF> were quoted by Dow Jones International Petroleum Report <COREF ID="46" REF="X13">yesterday</COREF> as saying that while <COREF ID="47" REF="X11">the government</COREF> isn't backing down on <COREF ID="48" REF="47">its</COREF> demand for a higher <COREF ID="49" REF="40">OPEC</COREF> quota, <COREF ID="50" REF="42">current production</COREF> is well under <COREF ID="51" REF="X9">the target</COREF>. 


 Industry estimates generally place <COREF ID="52" REF="50">the Emirates' current production</COREF> at between 1.2 million and 1.5 million barrels <COREF ID="54" REF="X6">a day</COREF>. 
 Until recently, <COREF ID="X21">such excess output by the Emirates</COREF> would have been ignored. 
 But <COREF ID="56" REF="X21">it</COREF> became an issue for <COREF ID="57" REF="49">OPEC</COREF> -- as well as for <COREF ID="X22">the world oil markets</COREF> -- last month, when <COREF ID="X23">Emirates' officials</COREF> went public with <COREF ID="60" REF="X23">their</COREF> intent to renounce <COREF ID="61" REF="X18">their quota</COREF>. 


 <COREF ID="X24">That</COREF> not only focused new attention on <COREF ID="63" REF="7">OPEC output</COREF>, which had begun climbing in late June, as previously reported, but <COREF ID="65" REF="X24">it</COREF> also raised concern among <COREF ID="X25">other exporters</COREF>. 


 With <COREF ID="X26">Iraq</COREF> also excluded from <COREF ID="66" REF="57">the system</COREF> as a result of fallout from <COREF ID="67" REF="X26">its</COREF> war with Iran, "<COREF ID="68" REF="57">they</COREF> are afraid that if <COREF ID="69" REF="45">the UAE</COREF> continues outside there will be no control over <COREF ID="70" REF="X25">the others</COREF>," said Bahman Karbassioun, a Vienna-based consultant on <COREF ID="71" REF="68">OPEC</COREF> affairs. 


 In addition to <COREF ID="72" REF="22">Mr. Subroto</COREF>'s visit to <COREF ID="73" REF="X14">Abu Dhabi</COREF>, <COREF ID="74" REF="71">OPEC</COREF>'s <COREF ID="75" REF="X32">price</COREF>-monitoring committee of five leading <COREF ID="76" REF="X33">oil</COREF> ministers also is tentatively scheduled to meet next Wednesday in Lausanne, Switzerland, to address the problem of <COREF ID="77" REF="69">the Emirates</COREF>' unilateral <COREF ID="78" REF="61">quota</COREF> decision, and to review <COREF ID="79" REF="75">world oil prices</COREF>. 
 But <COREF ID="81" REF="74">OPEC</COREF>'s headquarters <COREF ID="82" REF="46">yesterday</COREF> still declined to confirm details of <COREF ID="X27">the meeting</COREF>. 
 "<COREF ID="83" REF="X27">It</COREF>'s tentative because <COREF ID="84" REF="83">it</COREF> depends on the outcome of <COREF ID="85" REF="X19">the talks in the UAE</COREF>," said an <COREF ID="87" REF="81">OPEC</COREF> spokesman. 


 Meanwhile, <COREF ID="88" REF="63">total OPEC output</COREF> has dropped as much as 5% after <COREF ID="90" REF="X5">the recent run-up</COREF> -- with <COREF ID="91" REF="X10">Saudi Arabia, </COREF><COREF ID="92" REF="91">the cartel's biggest producer,</COREF> pacing the declines. 
 PetroLogistics Ltd., a Geneva-based consulting firm that closely monitors <COREF ID="94" REF="88">OPEC output</COREF>, estimates production for <COREF ID="X28">July</COREF> had averaged <COREF ID="X29">just over 19 million barrels a day</COREF> after reaching <COREF ID="97" REF="X7">20 million barrels a day in the first week of the month</COREF>. 


 <COREF ID="100" REF="X29">That</COREF>'s in line with demand for <COREF ID="101" REF="87">OPEC</COREF> oil for the second half, according to a current report on <COREF ID="102" REF="X22">world oil markets</COREF> by <COREF ID="X30">Charles L. McSpadden, </COREF><COREF ID="104" REF="X30">manager of petroleum analysis,</COREF> and <COREF ID="X31">Antonio M. Szabo, </COREF><COREF ID="106" REF="X31">manager of petroleum planning, at Bonner @amp; Moore Market Consultants, Houston</COREF>. 
 "<COREF ID="108" REF="100">The 19 million barrels a day</COREF> is in <COREF ID="110" REF="101">OPEC</COREF>'s comfort zone," said <COREF ID="111" REF="106">Mr. Szabo</COREF>.
