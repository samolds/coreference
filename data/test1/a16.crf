c.1996 South China Morning Post
By JONATHAN HILL and ADAM LEE in Macau <COREF ID="5">Two Chinese crew members</COREF>
were killed Tuesday when their helicopter crashed near <COREF ID="8">Macau</COREF>.


The China Southern Helicopter Company <COREF ID="9">aircraft</COREF> was on <COREF ID="10">its</COREF> way to
Zhuhai, apparently returning from an oil rig, when <COREF ID="11">it</COREF> crashed, said
a spokesman for Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Department.


Other reports said <COREF ID="13">the helicopter</COREF>, which went down 10 to 15
nautical miles southeast of the Portuguese enclave, was gathering
weather information.


<COREF ID="14">The incident</COREF> fell within Hong Kong airspace, triggering a search
by Civil Aviation Department rescuers.


Two Government Flying Service helicopters joined <COREF ID="16">Macau</COREF> Marine
Police in <COREF ID="17">the search</COREF> for <COREF ID="18">the Sikorsky 76</COREF>.


<COREF ID="19">Mainland</COREF> authorities later told <COREF ID="20">the department</COREF>'s Aeronautical
Rescue Co-ordination Centre the wreckage had been recovered from
the Chinese island of <COREF ID="21">Daiwaishan</COREF>.


``Someone on <COREF ID="22">the island</COREF> heard a noise and called <COREF ID="23">Zhuhai</COREF> airport
authorities,'' said a <COREF ID="24">Macau</COREF> aviation source. ``<COREF ID="25">China</COREF> sent a
helicopter and confirmed <COREF ID="26">the crash</COREF> on <COREF ID="27">the island</COREF>.''


<COREF ID="28">Macau</COREF> authorities, who lost radar contact at 10 am, said <COREF ID="29">the
pilots</COREF> had been found at the site ``and appeared dead''.


<COREF ID="30">Zhuhai</COREF> officials confirmed <COREF ID="31">the crew</COREF> had been killed.


Sources suggested that poor weather was <COREF ID="32">the likely cause of the
crash</COREF>.


The Royal Observatory reported strong winds in the area at <COREF ID="34">the
time</COREF>. Rescuers also reported poor visibility.


<COREF ID="35">China</COREF>, as <COREF ID="36">the country of registration</COREF>, would investigate <COREF ID="37">the
incident</COREF>, the <COREF ID="38">Civil Aviation Department</COREF> said.
