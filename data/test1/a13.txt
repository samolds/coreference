FAMILIES SUE OVER AREOFLOT CRASH DEATHS

By PATRICIA YOUNG

c.1996 South China Morning Post



The Russian airline Aeroflot has been hit with a writ for loss
and damages, filed in Hong Kong by the families of seven passengers
killed in an air crash.


All 75 people on board the Aeroflot Airbus died when it ploughed
into a Siberian mountain in March 1994.


Aeroflot general manager for Hong Kong Vassili Tkatchenko said
on Tuesday he was unaware the writ had been filed.


The writ is for "damages, interest and costs" of seven
passengers who died when the Moscow Airbus A310 flight bound for
Hong Kong crashed at Novokuznetsk, Siberia.


It claims the deaths were "caused by negligence, breach of
statutory duty and breach of contract on the part of the defendant
[Aeroflot]."


Air industry investigators say the 15-year-old son of Captain
Yaroslav Kudrinsky was flying the Hong Kong-bound aircraft after it
left Moscow. Black box transcripts show Eldar and Yana, his
13-year-old sister, were in the cockpit prior to the crash.


Airline passengers are protected under a section of the Warsaw
Convention relating to air travel which was signed on October 12,
1929.


The liability of the carrier for death or personal injury to
passengers has an upper limit of US$75,000. But larger amounts have
been awarded through the courts or through out-of-court
settlements.


Aviation consultant Steve Miller, the managing director of
Trinity Aviation, said he was unaware of any aviation court
settlements in Hong Kong.


"Taking it to the courts is very unusual for Hong Kong," Mr
Miller said.


Six of the claims in the writs were filed by family members who
live outside Hong Kong.
