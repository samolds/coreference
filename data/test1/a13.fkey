<COREF ID="3" REF="2">FAMILIES</COREF> SUE OVER <COREF ID="X4">AREOFLOT CRASH DEATHS</COREF>
By PATRICIA YOUNG
c.1996 South China Morning Post



<COREF ID="6" REF="1">The Russian airline Aeroflot</COREF> has been hit with <COREF ID="X5">a writ</COREF> for loss
and damages, filed in <COREF ID="X6">Hong Kong</COREF> by <COREF ID="7" REF="3">the families</COREF> of seven passengers
killed in an air crash.


All 75 people on board <COREF ID="X7">the Aeroflot Airbus</COREF> died when <COREF ID="12" REF="X7">it</COREF> ploughed
into a Siberian mountain in March 1994.


<COREF ID="X8">Aeroflot general manager for Hong Kong Vassili Tkatchenko</COREF> said
on Tuesday <COREF ID="15" REF="X8">he</COREF> was unaware <COREF ID="16" REF="X5">the writ</COREF> had been filed.


<COREF ID="17" REF="16">The writ</COREF> is for ``damages, interest and costs'' of seven
passengers who died when <COREF ID="19" REF="12">the Moscow Airbus A310 flight</COREF> bound for
<COREF ID="22" REF="X6">Hong Kong</COREF> crashed at Novokuznetsk, Siberia.


<COREF ID="23" REF="17">It</COREF> claims <COREF ID="24" REF="X4">the deaths</COREF> were ``caused by negligence, breach of
statutory duty and breach of contract on the part of <COREF ID="25" REF="6">the defendant</COREF>
[<COREF ID="26" REF="25">Aeroflot</COREF>].''


Air industry investigators say <COREF ID="X9">the 15-year-old son of Captain
Yaroslav Kudrinsky</COREF> was flying <COREF ID="27" REF="19">the Hong Kong-bound aircraft</COREF> after <COREF ID="29" REF="27">it</COREF>
left Moscow. Black box transcripts show <COREF ID="31" REF="X9">Eldar</COREF> and <COREF ID="X10">Yana</COREF>, <COREF ID="32" REF="X10">his 13-year-old sister</COREF>, were in the cockpit prior to the crash.


<COREF ID="X11">Airline passengers</COREF> are protected under a section of the Warsaw
Convention relating to air travel which was signed on October 12,
1929.


The liability of the carrier for death or personal injury to
<COREF ID="35" REF="X11">passengers</COREF> has <COREF ID="X12">an upper limit of US$75,000</COREF>. But larger amounts have
been awarded through the courts or through out-of-court
settlements.


<COREF ID="X13">Aviation consultant Steve Miller</COREF>, <COREF ID="37" REF="X13">the managing director</COREF> of
Trinity Aviation, said <COREF ID="38" REF="37">he</COREF> was unaware of any aviation court
settlements in <COREF ID="39" REF="22">Hong Kong</COREF>.


``Taking <COREF ID="40" REF="23">it</COREF> to the courts is very unusual for <COREF ID="41" REF="39">Hong Kong</COREF>,'' <COREF ID="42" REF="38">Mr
Miller</COREF> said.


Six of the claims in <COREF ID="43" REF="40">the writs</COREF> were filed by <COREF ID="44" REF="7">family members who
live outside Hong Kong</COREF>.
